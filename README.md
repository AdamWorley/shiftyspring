# Shifty

## About
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mada360/shiftyspring.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mada360/shiftyspring)

## Usage
**Requires Docker installation**

To run an instance of Shifty simply ensure that Docker is installed and from the root directory (the one with the Dockerfile) use the following command `sudo ./setup.sh`. Docker requires sudo privileges and so the setup script will not run without the required permissions.

Once running the shifty api will be accessible though `[](http://localhost:8080/shiftyspring)`.
